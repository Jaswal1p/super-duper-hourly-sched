# super-duper-hourly-sched

This project was a great learning experience, where I got to practice some HTML, CSS and my early understanding of Javascript. 

I also found out where my deficiencies are- 

    1. How to code the saved user input to a particular text area. Right now it saves on a different page and I remember that we learbed this is Taskinator lessons. I will relearn that.
    
    2. CSS color styling of the rows was successful, for the code that I wrote my self. But I have difficulty integrating with live clock display I added to the application.
    
    3. I wrote the code for changing color with time, according to my understanding of concept (that I am still saving in script.js file). But I am missing some minor detail. It worked one time and than it was gone and I could not figure out this integration. My mind is completely numb and I need to sleep and take a break. So I am right now submitting it as is. 
    
    4. Most of my JS code is also in html file, as it was easier to work right in it. I will have to put all that in JS at some point. Right now I am nervous before submission and would like to submit it when it has most of the funtionality.


I would like you to give me feedback on following points -

    1. Am I directionally correct on this challenge?

    2. Was I correct to go choose Table model for this project? I realize that I could have done it with <divs> too.

    3. Any other material concept understanding mistake (not the details as I would like to work and learn by myself)? 


Thanks.
